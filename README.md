- Sends a notification to a Slack channel using a webhook

## Requirements

- An AWS account with access to Lambda and CloudWatch services
- Python 3.x
- Request layer added to the Lambda function


## Configuration

To use this code, you need to update some variable values in the source file:

1. Set the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` variable to your Slack webhook URL. You can obtain this URL by creating a new incoming webhook integration in your Slack workspace.
2. Set the `LOG_GROUP_NAME` variable to the name of the AWS CloudWatch log group you want to query.
3. Set the `QUERY` variable to the specific query you want to execute on the log group.
4. Modify the conditional check in the source code as needed for your use case.
5. Customize the Slack message content that will be sent as a notification.

## Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the Lambda function:

1. Create a Lambda function in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI.
2. Upload the source code, either by zipping the files and uploading through the console, or using the AWS CLI.
3. Set the Lambda function handler, runtime, and other configurations as needed.
4. Add the necessary layers, such as the Request layer, to the Lambda function.
5. Add necessary triggers, such as CloudWatch events or other AWS services, to invoke the Lambda function.
6. Test the Lambda function to ensure it is working as expected.
